# GW2UtilityTool
This project is my attempt at creating utility tool that provides help with simple task needed to be done in game called Guild Wars 2.  
I wanted to create something that will take my manual labor off of me while still not breaking Terms and Conditions of the game. However I did not read every sentence in T&C so if you decide to use it do it at your own risk.
